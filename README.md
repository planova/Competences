 Planova was founded in 1964 as a supplier to businesses in Denmark. In a short time Planova had grown to become one of Scandinavia’s largest suppliers of steel systems to the forecourt and supermarket sectors. During the 60’s Planova cemented its position as the leading supplier of shop fittings to the Fuel industry and amongst many projects designed and delivered the first convenience stores for BP in 1965. Following this – the growth of Planova moved in a higher gear.  From 2007 to 2013 the group expanded with additional affiliates in Poland, Germany, UK, China and Bulgaria.
